# Telco_Customer_churn_prediction_using_ML

This project is mainly focus on predicting customer churn in a telecommunications  company using Machine Learning. 
I explore data preprocessing,feature selection ,model training and evaluation to build a robust predictive model

I started by cleaning data and after that 
1.Data Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling and transformation


2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding data distribution
- Indentfying key churn indicators

3.Feature Selection 
- Correlation analysis
- Removing redundant features

4.Model Building 
- Logistic Regression ,Random Forest. XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning

5.Model Evaluation
- Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve
